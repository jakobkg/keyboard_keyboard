# The Keyboard Keyboard

A mechanical keyboard, with a pinao-esque layout, or a MIDI keyboard with MX style switches and (hopefully) QMK firmware?
This is a keyboard design for the very tiny segment of people who think the "computer keyboard as MIDI input" in Ableton is neat, and want more of the same.
